## Main Notebooks

The following notebooks contain the primary analysis and model development steps:

1. **`eda_0_generic_features_understanding.ipynb`**: Provides a comprehensive analysis of each feature in the dataset.
2. **`eda_1_univariate_bivariate_analyses.ipynb`**: Conducts guided univariate and bivariate analysis based on instructions in the `documents/` folder.
3. **`models_training_and_evaluation.ipynb`**: Contains the workflow for model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.


Each notebook provides step-by-step code and comments to guide the analysis process.
